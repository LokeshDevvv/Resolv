## üåê **Technical Architecture**  
### **1. Privacy Layer**  
- **Blockchain**: [Oasis Sapphire Network](https://oasisprotocol.org/technology/sapphire).  
- **Role**: Manages user verification and sensitive data using encrypted storage.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Privacy-preserving verification avoids exposing user data.  
  - Encrypted data ensures secure yet verifiable reports.  

### **2. Public Reporting Platform**  
- **Blockchain**: Multichain system implemented on various L2 chains.  
- **Role**: Handles public data like reports, votes, and point systems.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - High scalability for frequent interactions.  
  - Cost-effective operations with low transaction fees.  
  - Polygon zkEVM Cardona Sepolia, Sapphire, Base Sepolia, Zircuit, Scroll Sepolia.

### **3. Decentralized Storage**  
- **Storage Network**: [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/).  
- **Role**: Stores media like photos and videos attached to reports.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Decentralized, permanent storage via IPFS.  
  - Content-addressing ensures data integrity and accessibility.

## ü§ñ **AI Integration**  
Our platform uses the **Hyperbolic Pixtral-12B Vision Model**, which:  
1. Analyzes images and descriptions to assess issues and their severity.  
2. Suggests actionable solutions and assigns priority levels.  
3. Matches report text with image content, ensuring accurate and relevant submissions.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy & Security**  
- **Privacy by Design**: All user data remains encrypted and private using Sapphire.  
- **Community Validation**: Decentralized moderation reduces bias and prevents spam.  
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain technology ensures every report is tamper-proof and traceable.  

---

## üéÆ **Incentive Mechanism**  
- **Reward System**: Token-based rewards for verified reports and community contributions.  
- **Upvotes/Downvotes**: Blockchain-recorded votes adjust report credibility and improve prioritization.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Automatically distribute rewards fairly and transparently.

## üõ§Ô∏è **How It Works**  
1. **User Submission**:  
   - Upload a report with an image, description, and optional location.  
2. **AI Analysis**:  
   - AI validates the content, categorizes the issue, and assigns a severity score.  
3. **Community Voting**:  
   - Users upvote or downvote based on the report‚Äôs accuracy and relevance.  
4. **Transparency & Action**:  
   - Authorities and users track updates and resolutions in real-time.

## üß© **Challenges & Solutions**  
### **Challenge: Privacy in Multichain Architecture**  
- **Solution**: Privacy-preserving verification on Sapphire ensures sensitive data remains encrypted while public chains handle transparency.  

### **Challenge: Spam Prevention**  
- **Solution**: Sophisticated point system with penalties for false reports and rewards for quality contributions.
